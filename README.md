# Quizzical

A quiz application for creating and taking quizzes on various subjects.

For the production version, download the application here: https://joosep.xyz/quizzical-pss.

## Structure

The project consists of 2 parts: the server in the `server/` directory and the client-side desktop application in the `client/` directory. In order to use the application both server and client need to be set up.

The website is in the `docs/` directory so that it can be easily hosted with GitHub pages.

## Set up

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/quizzical.git
```

Follow the readme files in the server and the desktop app directories to set both of them up.

* `server/README.md`
* `client/README.md`
